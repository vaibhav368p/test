       <h1>What Is Coronavirus ?</h1>
       <h2>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.</h2>

       <h4>What Is Covid-19 ?</h4>
       <h5>COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms</h5>

       <br><br> <br>
       <p1>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
        Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
        Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
        Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
        Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
        Get vaccinated when its your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
        Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
        Stay home if you feel unwell.</p1>

            <h7 class="footer1">Social Distancing</h7>
            <br><br>
            <p2>As communities reopen and people are more often in public, the term “physical distancing” (instead of social distancing) is being used to reinforce the need to stay at least 6 feet from others, as well as wearing face masks.  Historically, social distancing was also used interchangeably to indicate physical distancing which is defined below.  However, social distancing is a strategy distinct from the physical distancing behavior.</p2>

            <h8 class="footer3">Face Masks & respiratory hygiene</h8>
            <p3>COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets travel into the air when you cough, sneeze, talk, shout, or sing. These droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people who are near you or they may breathe these droplets in. </p3>
